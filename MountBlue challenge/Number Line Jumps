  You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).

The first kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
The second kangaroo starts at location  and moves at a rate of  meters per jump.
You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.





 public static String kangaroo(int x1, int v1, int x2, int v2) {
    // Write your code here
 if (v1 == v2) {
        // if speeds are same but positions different, they will never meet
        return (x1 == x2) ? "YES" : "NO";
    }
    int X = x2 - x1;
    int V = v1 - v2;

    // they can meet only if:
    // 1. deltaX divisible by deltaV (n is an integer)
    // 2. n >= 0
    if (V != 0 && X % V == 0 && (X / V) >= 0) {
        return "YES";
    } else {
        return "NO";
    }

    }

}
