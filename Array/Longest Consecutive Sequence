Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9


Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

class Solution {

                int x=num;                     /// till here we are finding the starting point means if there is 102 and in array there is present 103 them we will not itterate 
                                                    we will go the the 103 and so on ex [102,4,100,101,1,2,3] output will be 4 bcoz 1234 is consecutive thats why we are finding
                                                    the starting point to iterate.

            
            while(ans.contains(x+1)){        // here after getting the atarting point like 100 or 1 so we will increse the cnt of consecutive if set is contains or not
                x=x+1;
                cnt++;
            }
            longest=Math.max(longest,cnt);
